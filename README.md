# Startup Weekend Games 2013 
This is the software project behind our [Startup Weekend Games](http://hamburg.startupweekend.org) application. We'll try to build a toolbox to tell stories, interactively.

## How to install and hack

In order to hack in this, you need to install these on your machine:

* node.js

If you're done installing these, go check out the project with GitHub for Windows or this on the command line:

    git clone git@github.com:kjellski/SWHHG13.git

After that, open the folder you've checked it out into, and type this on the command line:

    npm install && bower install && grunt workon
